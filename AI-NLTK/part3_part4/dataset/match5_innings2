6.10 pm It's a pretty flat pitch out there, though there was some movement with the new ball. India have taken down scores above 300 in the past. Can they pace this innings as well and come away with a win, or will they be forced to tuck their tails between their legs and lose 0-4? Kyle Mills to open for New Zealand as Rohit Sharma takes strike. Two slips 


Samir Salvi: "Indian bowlers again give our batsmen the opportunity  to score a century! Let's see who will going to grab this opportunity. "

Mills to Sharma,
no run,
fullish and on off again as Rohit blocks off the front foot

back of a length just outside off as Rohit opens the face to guide it into the covers. Wanted a single, but it wasn't there  
0.4

width outside off as Rohit leans into a lovely square drive. Timed nicely off the front foot, but it finds point  
0.5
Mills to Sharma,
no run,
back of a length on middle as Rohit stays in line and pushes down the pitch  
0.6
Mills to Sharma,
no run,
loose that time as he looks to drive on the up. Poking well away from the body as this was on a length outside off. Beaten  

sathish2888: "Interesting to see how Indian openers go about this run chase. If Rohit rotates the strike it will be sign of improvement.."


Mitch McClenaghan takes up the charge from the other end. Two slips in

1.1
McClenaghan to Dhawan,
no run,
135 kph, gets a bit of shape away from Dhawan as this is on a fuller length and outside off. Watchfully left alone

no run,
137 kph, fullish on off stump as he stretches forward to block with bat and pad close together  
1.3
McClenaghan to Dhawan,
1 run,
140 kph, fullish and just a touch outside off as Dhawan looked to pierce the cover field. Touch of movement in foils the shot as it is mis-hit to mid-on and they sneak a single  
1.4
McClenaghan to Sharma,
1 run,
139kph, shortish and angles it across as Rohit stands up on his toes and guides it off an open face to third man  

Jesse Ryder is off the field because of a blow to the leg sustained while batting

1.5

1 run,
too straight as this length ball is turned behind square leg

no run,
127kph, bouncer over middle and leg as Dhawan ducks underneath.  
2.2
Mills to Dhawan,
no run,
squares him up with a back of a length ball pushed across him. Dhawan manages to ride it to point  
2.3

no run,
full and just outside off and Dhawan's usual timing is off hiding somewhere. Drives down the ground, but gets more of an edge to mid-off

no run,
another good short ball, this one pushed across Dhawan, who sways inside the line  
2.5
Mills to Dhawan,
no run,
fullish and very tight on off stump as Dhawan presses forward to block  
2.6
Mills to Dhawan,
1 run,
almost sold him down the river, but they pick up the single eventually off the overthrow. Dabs the back of a length ball on off into the covers and took a few steps. Rohit responded only to see Dhawan change his mind. The underarm throw is not accurate though  
3.1
McClenaghan to Dhawan,
no run,
short with a bit of width as Dhawan looks to send it up and over point. A bit too slow on it as it bounces over the flashing blade  
3.2
McClenaghan to Dhawan,
no run,
Nathan's pounched  one at second slip, has he? No, he's uncertain. And it's bounced just short of him. Genuine edge from Dhawan as this was back of a length on off stump. Poked at it with hard hands and is lucky it didn't carry  
3.3
McClenaghan to Dhawan,
1 run,
goes on the bounce to deep third man. Touch of width outside off and he cuts strongly. McClenaghan thought it was going straight down his throat  
3.4
McClenaghan to Sharma,
no run,
140kph, short delivery again tucking him up above his stomach as Rohit is up off his feet to drop it down towards midwicket  
3.5

1 run,
worked this away between square leg and midwicket as he raises the front leg off the ground and works the short ball outside off away  
3.6
McClenaghan to Dhawan,
no run,
140kph, fullish on middle as Dhawan goes forward and pushes down the ground  

Sanjay: "Same old routine with Indian openers... lack of runs at the start of the innings... really disappointing.."

4.1
Mills to Sharma,
no run,
fullish on off stump and Rohit is unable to do much more than defend it back to the bowler  
4.2
Mills to Sharma,
2 runs,
forces the pace as he moves outside leg and lofts this length ball over mid-off. Didn't time it properly and it holds up in the outfield near the boundary  
4.3
Mills to Sharma,
OUT,
oh my, he's given a spot of catching practice to first slip! Taylor's stunned at how easy it all was. Short of a length ball just outside off and he went to guide it to third man, forgetting there are two slips in place. It goes too fine and he succumbs to a catch above shoulder-height  
RG Sharma c Taylor b Mills 4 (20m 13b 0x4 0x6) SR: 30.76  

Here's Virat Kohli

4.4

goes wide of the crease as this is angled in on a good length, left alone by Kohli  
5.1

no run,
back of a length on off stump as he blocks  
5.3
McClenaghan to Dhawan,
no run,

5.4
McClenaghan to Dhawan,
no run,
goes a touch fuller and keeps it on a fifth stump line, Dhawan doesn't want to play  
5.5
McClenaghan to Dhawan,
FOUR,
it was hit a little uppishly, but he's placed it to the left of mid-on. Touch too full and straight as Dhawan clips it off the front foot through midwicket  
5.6
McClenaghan to Dhawan,
no run,
143 kph, he's nailed that! Full and a bit wide of off and Dhawan leans into a punishing cover drive, but can't beat the man in the infield  

Suman Dustakar: "Shame Old Story"


Vikram AR: "Swapping the openers are not the fix. We would need some one on top like Rahane... I would prefer Rahane to open and Rohit to come down the order.. That might balance the batting..."

6.1
Mills to Kohli,
no run,
length ball outside off as Kohli shoulders arms  
6.2
Mills to Kohli,
no run,

6.4
Mills to Kohli,
no run,
good length ball just outside off as Kohli dabs it with an open face to point  
6.5
Mills to Kohli,
3 runs,
strays too straight and Kohli capitalises. Leans forward and clips smartly straight of midwicket with a roll of his wrists. Good running gives them three  
6.6
Mills to Dhawan,
no run,
back of a length on middle as Dhawan can only knock it back to the bowler  

Hitesh: "As elegant as he looks, RG Sharma this series: caught at 3 in first ODI, dropped at 4 in second (Williamson), dropped at 0 in third (Ryder), dropped at 14 in fourth (Taylor). His habit of poking and slicing to slips and point hasn't changed over the years. I wish those catches were held and he would've learned some lesson prior to today."


Matt Henry to have his first ball in international cricket

7.1
Henry to Kohli,
no run,
136 kph, back of a length and it darts back off the pitch. Kohli wasn't expecting that as he is slow on his flick. Too skiddy for him as it goes off his thigh pad  
7.2
Henry to Kohli,
no run,
137 kph, gets good carry through to the keeper as this is back of a length and outside off. Kohli lets it go  
7.3
Henry to Kohli,
FOUR,
140kph, dismissed! Banged in too short and Kohli is on the back foot and lays into this. Saw it early and hit it so hard through midwicket  
7.4
Henry to Kohli,
no run,
141kph, good length ball outside off, much better in line as Kohli leaves  
7.5
Henry to Kohli,
no run,
135 kph, bit of shape away as this is fuller and just outside off. Kohli is drawn forward and into a tame poke, beaten  
7.6
Henry to Kohli,
no run,
140 kph, just short of a good length and this moves in after pitching. Still well enough outside off for Kohli not to play at it  

Tahir Shah: "A touch of Shane Bond in Henry's run off and bowling action. Hope the quality is somewhere near Bond too."


Cric expert: "Albert Einstein defines Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results... Hmm"

8.3
Mills to Kohli,
no run,
fullish and just outside off as he leans nicely forward and blocks  
8.4
Mills to Kohli,
no run,
solid front foot stride and punches this right back at the bowler. Crisp drive on the up from Kohli, for no runs. That might develop into a bruise for Mills  
8.5
Mills to Kohli,
no run,
short and wide outside off and Kohli was into the cut too early. Frustrated yell from him as this is mistimed into the covers  
8.6
Mills to Kohli,

back of a length and outside off, Kohli looks to drop it into the off side and run, but the fielders are too quick

9.2
Henry to Dhawan,
no run,
139 kph, fullish and tight on the stumps as Dhawan looks to whip it through midwicket. Only manages an inside edge onto pad  
9.3
Henry to Dhawan,
no run,
appreciable curl in at 140 kph as this is pitched right up there. Dhawan is forced to hurry in his efforts to keep the ball out of his stumps  
9.4
Henry to Dhawan,
no run,
bouncer on middle nad leg to follow up as Dhawan ducks under it  
9.5
Henry to Dhawan,
OUT,
maiden wicket for Henry and it's a pretty good one to as he draws Dhawan's edge and is pouched at second slip. It was back of a length and pushed across the left-hander, who pokes at it with the back foot moving down the leg side and away from the ball. He did try to rein the bat in, but it was too late.  
S Dhawan c NL McCullum b Henry 9 (43m 28b 1x4 0x6) SR: 32.14

bit of width on offer as Kohli stays back and steers the shotish ball to deep point

full on middle and leg and that is meat and drink for Kohli as he clips it away to deep midwicket

sucker ball and Kohli was almost lured in. Full and angled across him and he was looking to flay it through the covers. But decides to leave it instead  
12.6
McClenaghan to Kohli,
no run,
oh, is that a catch? Guptill, the fielder, says no straight away. It was full and angled across Kohli again. A littler closer to him this time as he goes for the drive on the up. Goes in the air to cover and doesn't carry  
13.1
Henry to Rahane,
no run,
full on middle and leg as he comes forward and dives to mid-on  
13.2
Henry to Rahane,
OUT,
another one for Henry! And Rahane's missed a straight one! He was swinging across the line to a fullish delivery angled in at him. Struck in line with the stumps and would have crashed into middle  
AM Rahane lbw b Henry 2 (15m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20.00  

Ambati Rayudu is the new man. Can he get the scoreboard going?

no run,
good length ball on middle and off as he blocks

strays on the pads as he clips it away to deep midwicket and that's just two. Should have gone for the extra one there. It went almost all the way to the boundary  

It was almost a five-ball over, but the umpire's have figured out their mistake just in time


Lailesh: "Over to Kohli n Dhoni....Just a day in the office"

13.6
Henry to Rayudu,
no run,
good length ball outside off, goes just inside the wide line as Rayudu leaves

15.1

15.2

FOUR,
bit of movement away for Henry, only this was a half-volley outside off. Rayudu gets a nice stride forward and drives through the covers. Full flow of the bat and India get a much needed boundary  
15.3
Henry to Rayudu,
no run,
full and a bit wide of off again, this time Rayudu's timing deserts him as it goes off the bottom of the bat down the ground, more swing away  
15.4
Henry to Rayudu,
no run,
good length ball outside off, Rayudu won't bother with this  
15.5
Henry to Rayudu,
no run,
136kph, extracts some bounce off the wicket as this is on a good length outside off. Rayudu won't be drawn into a stroke  
15.6
Henry to Rayudu,
1 run,
full and just outside off as he goes for a drive. Gets a thick outside edge down to third man and that will be drinks 

India's run-rate is yet to breach the 3 per over mark. The top-order has taken up far too many balls and have not taken advantage of the time spent in the middle. Very stiff chase on the cards. Only one batsman in double figures at this stage


Rahul: "India has already started practicing for test matches.. "


hardik: "Look at the contrast in the bowling figures...For India it is everything above 6 an over and for NZ...see for yourself...the hope for a good, tight Indian bowling unit is an illusion over the years..."

McClenaghan to Rayudu,
no run,
bit of width on offer but Rayudu can only chop it as far as point  
16.2
McClenaghan to Rayudu,
no run,
shortish and wide again, but Rayudu had already moved his front leg outside leg stump. Which means he has too much room and the cut shot goes to gully  
16.3
McClenaghan to Rayudu,
1 run,
this time gets it past the infield, but deep point is there to field this cut shot off the shorter ball outside off  
16.4
McClenaghan to Kohli,
1 run,
bouncer on middle as Kohli is on the back foot and hooks down and to deep square leg  
16.5
McClenaghan to Rayudu,

16.6
McClenaghan to Rayudu,
no run,
136 kph, charges him but McClenaghan has seen it. Seemed to have changed his action a touch as he dug this in short and ensured the ball sailed over his flashing blade outside off  

Jimmy Neesham to bowl

17.6
Neesham to Kohli,
FOUR,
overpitched on middle as Kohli strides forward and presents a dead straight bat. Second boundary off the over and possibly the best of the innings so far. Not that there's a whole lot to choose from
