Kyle Mills will be opening the bowling, with Dhawan on strike
Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan are already out in the centre, while the New Zealand fielders assemble in their respective positions.
Hi all. Rohan here. George has had enough of all the rain delays so I will be taking you through the second innings. New Zealand have set India a daunting chase of 297 off 42 overs. But you can never really discount this Indian side as they have the kind of batsmen who can overhaul whatever target comes their way (read Hobart 2012). The smaller grounds will also play into their hands as they will need to land more than a few meaty blows over the rope if they are to make a decent crack at this chase.

11.3
Southee to Kohli,
FOUR,
Kohli is taking the risks. Dances down the wicket, smashes this outswinger towards cover. Ryder has a half chance at short cover, but this one is absolutely flying at it. In fact he does well to get a touch to it, which doesn't keep this from crashing into the boundary boards

And that will be drinks
Hari Guruvu: "I feel that Pujara should be in the Indian squad for ODI's too. He can come to bat at 4th position. Pujara will add a lot of balance to the team in situations where the openers lose their wickets early. Thoughts?"

14.6
NL McCullum to Rahane,

The most painful one was his innings against pakistan in 2nd ODI in the last bilateral ODI series between these two sides. "

Kohli saw this one early as this slow  
29.4
Southee to Kohli,

V Kohli c sub (AP Devcich) b Southee 78 (88m 65b 7x4 2x6) SR: 120.00

Mills to Raina,
no run,
uses his feet to time this one to the off side as the pair start off for a single. Guptill picks this one up at silly mid-on before firing in a throw which just bounces over the stumps as this looked in line to hit. Raina lucky to get away with this one as Gups doesn't miss often

in the slot as Raina is able to club this back over long-on to find the boundary

35.1

again on the pads from McClenaghan and he is punished with a delightful clip which races to the fine leg boundary, with no fielder in sight

no run,
fuller one angling in on off as Raina deflects this back towards the bowler

1 run,
shortish length which is helped down to deep fine leg with a swivel  
Kannan G: "I think NZ bowlers are bowling to a plan for MSD. I see them constantly targeting his thigh pad and MSD is not able to get them away except may be through fine leg. Is this a weakness which the NZ think tank has found ?"
36.1
Mills to Raina,
OUT,
and Mills strikes as Raina is baited to go after a fuller one on leg which is hit higher than father towards midwicket, with Southee getting under it comfortably to take this catch. Big wicket for NZ, but the one they really want is still at the crease

forced away by Dhoni on the leg side for a single  
36.4

36.5
Mills to Jadeja,
1 run,
slower ball on the same line which is run down to short third man for a quick single  
And Dhoni once again asks for his collection of bats to try out with. Had decided he will stick with the one he is using. Not like it has been woeful by any means...
36.6
Mills to Dhoni,
2 runs,
Dhoni just stands his ground and hammers this length ball over midwicket, but doesn't have enough on it for it to reach the boundary as deep midwicket is quick to get it  
Gaurav: "And.. helicopter blades are out on the field!"
Anderson back into the attack now
37.1
Anderson to Jadeja,

37.2
Anderson to Dhoni,
FOUR,
dropped Southee what have you done? You were with Dhoni at CSK, you should know better than to drop him at this stage of the match as Dhoni hammers one from Corey, but this one goes quite high up, threatening not to reach the midwicket boundary, but Southee is unable to get a grasp on it as he lets it fall before continuing on to the rope  
37.3
Anderson to Dhoni,
FOUR,
and luck continues to ride with Dhoni as he ends up getting a thick outside edge to this length ball outside off, which deflects to the keeper, who is unable to get his paws on it as it continues to the right of him to the third man boundary for yet another fortuitous boundary

38.5
Southee to Dhoni,
SIX,
and Dhoni plays the most elegant of lofted shots, mistiming this its execution, but the shot is able to carry just far enough for it to go over the extra-cover boundary for six. Also brings up his 52nd ODI fifty 
38.6
Southee to Dhoni,
1 run,
slaps this one away off the back foot down to deep midwicket for a single  
Ajay Malik: "Can we borrow Faulkner from across the sea for a while?"
39.1
Anderson to Dhoni,
OUT,
and Dhoni tries his luck one more time, but it ceases to come to fruition as he miscues this lofted shot off Anderson, with the ball travelling behind to backward point, where Williamson was able to get under the steepler, and more importantly, hold onto the chance. Ends a spirited innings from the Indian captain  
MS Dhoni c Williamson b Anderson 56 (81m 44b 7x4 1x6) SR: 127.27

Time for Bhuvneshwar to try his luck

39.6

The equation reads 37 off 12. Match in NZ's favour, but it's not over till it's over
40.1
Southee to Kumar,
1 run,
manages to dig this one out to the leg side for one  
40.2
Southee to Ashwin,

40.3
Southee to Ashwin,
OUT,
Ashwin has a high backlift and is already in position to get under this as he swats this fuller one over midwicket, but straight into the hands of deep midwicket, and it is that man, Guptill, who takes the catch. Just can't keep the NZ opener out of the match  
R Ashwin c Guptill b Southee 5 (7m 4b 1x4 0x6) SR: 125.00

41.1
Anderson to Kumar,
OUT,
and Kumar, in automatic six-hitting mode, ends up top-edging this length ball straight over to deep point, who takes a good catch to remove Bhuvi  
B Kumar c NL McCullum b Anderson 11 (9m 6b 2x4 0x6) SR: 183.33  
41.2
Anderson to Mohammed Shami,
1 run,
dropped and Shami this time tries his luck with a miscued heave that travels really, really high in the air on the leg side. Ronchi calls this one, as he should, but this one starts to swirl as it reaches back to Earth, with Ronchi unable to hold on to it  
41.3
Anderson to I Sharma,
1 run,
Ishant proceeds to slap this one away to the off side for a single, and while that happens the heavens start to open up as the umpires remove the bails to signal the end of the game 
And there you have it, New Zealand win this one in the end by 15 runs (D/L method) and go 2-0 up in the series. India, despite losing their ODI top ranking with this result, will not be too dismayed though, as they have shown their ability to compete on level terms with the home side. They will be hopeful they can turn it around come the 25th when they square off for the 3rd ODI in Auckland. Till then, though, this is Rohan Sharma signing off for ESPNcricinfo on behalf of George Binoy, and the scorer, Sanjay Murari. Have a good one, folks!
Kane Williamson, Man of the Match:  Yeah its going alright. Just playing the anchoring role in the middle after the big boys get dismissed. It has been quite good and a complete performance from the team. I tried to contribute as much as possible in both of these games. It was great to keep the momentum going for the home team, and we look forward to our next match. 
Brendon McCullum, NZ captain: Yeah it was a good performance. It was outstanding to get the total we did, and that too in a reduced game. We needed all those runs against India's packed batting. Prior to the weather I thought the batting was outstanding with Ross and Kane. Then Corey came back in today and showed just how much he has learned at this level to give us that momentum going into the second innings. Against the Indian team you know how dangerous their batting is. The team has really stepped up and performed well over these last two games. At the end of the day, under pressure, the guys did really well. In big moments he is really stepping up (Corey), and the way he came back with the ball showed his ability. Really pleased with the guys' performance, and I know we will get better and better as the series wears on.
MS Dhoni, India captain: The NZ fast bowlers, when they bowled the slower ones, it was hard to get them away. It was quite difficult to hit them away consistently, and in the end we couldn't get close to the 290 we needed. The last game I got out, and this game Virat got out, so it was important to keep continuing to build a partnership as it is hard for the players coming in to play their strokes freely. From the 25th/26th over we should have started to hit out, but it doesn't always go to plan. Yes the fast bowlers did well for us. Bhuvi was good at the death, while Shami has been performing quite consistently. We gave away a few extra runs but that is to be expected with the big hitters they have. It is better for the second team in limited-overs to know the target and what to do. 
will be back shortly for quotes from the match presentation
So for all accounts this match is done and dusted, with the final determination on just how many runs still needing to be decided. As it stands, New Zealand are 2-0 ahead in the series, with three matches left to decide the series. India once again came to the party, but I suspect it was the slow start of their openers that may have cost them this victory, along with the untimely nature of the rain today. We have received confirmation that New Zealand have won this encounter by 15 runs (D/L method)
India will not be too displeased that rain has intervened at this time. This match was slipping away further and further, and it seems the rain gods have taken mercy on them by letting them off the hook a little bit earlier than expected. The New Zealand players high-five one another as the Indian batsmen trudge off to the pavilion.
